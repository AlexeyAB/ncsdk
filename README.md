# Movidius™ Neural Compute Software Development Kit
This SDK is provided for users of the [Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick (NCS)](https://developer.movidius.com/).  It provides software tools, an API, and examples which enable developers to create software that takes advantage of the hardware the accelerated neural network capability provided by the NCS.

 
# Installation
The provided Makefile helps with installation.  Clone this repository and then run the following command to install the SDK.

```
make install
```

# Examples
Also included in the SDK are examples.  After cloning and running 'make install' run the following command to install examples.
```
